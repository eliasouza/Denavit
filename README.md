Computational implementation of the direct manipulator position kinematics of the planar and anthropomorphic robots with spherical handle and determination of tool position.
--------------------------------
Considering the links with the following lengths: 
10, 11, 12, 13 = 0.5m; 
14 and 15 = 0; 
16 = 0.1m;
--------------------------------
The position of the tool is determined for: 
qa = [0 0 0 0 0 0]T; 
Qb = [pi/2 0 pi/2 0 pi/2 pi/2]T; 
Qc = [pi/2 pi/6 2pi/3 0 0 p1/2]T;
Where t means transposed.
