Computational implementation of the direct manipulator position kinematics of the planar and anthropomorphic robots with spherical handle and determination of tool position.
--------------------------------
Considering the links with the following lengths: 
L10, L11, L12, and L13 = 0.5m; L14 and L15 = 0; L16 = 0.1m;
--------------------------------
The position of the tool is determined for: 
qa = [0 0 0 0 0 0]T; qb = [pi/2 0 pi/2 0 pi/2 pi/2]T; qc = [pi/2 pi/6 2pi/3 0 0 p1/2]T;
Where T means transposed.
